## AI Usage

For the third part of the project, I used ChatGPT to create the middleware for the register endpoint. With the express JSON middleware, I was unable to get the body containing the email and username so I had chatGPT create a function to parse through the body to get the JSON. I donâ€™t know why Express was unable to get the body because when I created a Flask server and did the same request it had no issue getting the body. To get the output from the AI I explained the issue in the prompt and had it create custom custom middleware until something worked. I also had it show me how to use the crypto library to do the AES encryption. For this, in the prompt I asked it how to implement AES encryption using the crypto library.
